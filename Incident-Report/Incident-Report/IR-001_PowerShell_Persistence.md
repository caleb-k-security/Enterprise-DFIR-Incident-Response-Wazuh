# Security Incident Report – IR-001

## Incident Summary
A high-severity security alert was generated by the SIEM indicating suspicious PowerShell execution on a Windows endpoint. Further investigation revealed encoded command execution followed by the creation of a registry run key, consistent with persistence techniques commonly associated with phishing-based attacks.

Based on alert correlation, endpoint telemetry, and behavioral indicators, the incident met escalation criteria for DFIR investigation.

## Detection Details
- **Detection Source:** Wazuh SIEM
- **Endpoint Type:** Windows 10
- **Alert Category:** Suspicious PowerShell Execution / Persistence
- **Severity Level:** High
- **MITRE ATT&CK Techniques:**
  - T1059.001 – PowerShell
  - T1547.001 – Registry Run Keys / Startup Folder

---

## Investigation Findings
Analysis of SIEM alerts and endpoint telemetry revealed:
- Execution of PowerShell using encoded command parameters
- Abnormal parent-child process behavior
- Modification of Windows registry run keys for persistence
- Activity inconsistent with legitimate administrative operations

These indicators strongly suggested malicious intent rather than user error or benign activity.

---

## Escalation Decision
The incident was escalated for DFIR investigation due to:
- Use of obfuscated PowerShell commands
- Establishment of persistence mechanisms
- High confidence behavioral indicators mapped to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

---

## Forensic Actions Taken
- Memory acquisition performed using industry-standard tooling
- Integrity of evidence preserved through cryptographic hashing
- Targeted disk artifacts collected to support timeline reconstruction
- Memory analysis conducted using Volatility 3 to identify suspicious processes

Raw forensic artifacts are excluded from this repository to preserve confidentiality and ethical standards.

---

## Impact Assessment
The activity indicated unauthorized code execution on the affected endpoint, presenting potential risks including credential exposure, data compromise, and lateral movement within the environment.

---

## Recommendations
- Immediate isolation of the affected endpoint
- Credential reset for impacted user accounts
- Review of email gateways and phishing logs
- Implementation of additional PowerShell logging controls
- Continued monitoring for similar indicators across the environment

---

## Analyst Notes
This incident demonstrates the importance of baseline validation, telemetry verification, and disciplined escalation within a SOC environment. Proper evidence handling and correlation enabled a high-confidence incident determination.
